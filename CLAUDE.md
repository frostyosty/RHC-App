# RHC (Rock Hard Christianity)

A distraction blocker and "time reclamation" app with two native clients that
share logic:

| Path | What it is | Toolchain |
|---|---|---|
| `rhc-android/` | Kotlin app, package `com.rockhard.blocker`, 4 product flavors (Gamers/Timesavers × Male/Female) | Gradle 8.7, AGP + Kotlin 1.9.22, JDK 17, compileSdk 34 |
| `rhc-desktop/` | Win32/GDI C++17 app + Windows service + NSIS installer | mingw-w64 cross-compile, `makensis` |
| `rhc-common/` | Shared C++ engines (SQLite `DatabaseManager`, Momentum, ShieldRuleEngine, Leaderboard) used by desktop; mirrors the Android Kotlin logic | — |
| `tools/` | Sprite Studio (Python, port 8080), icon generator (Node/sharp), helper scripts | Python 3 + Pillow, Node |

Feature-level detail (blocking, cooldown, Momentum, Netbeasts) lives in
`rhc-android/README.md`. Read it before changing behaviour.

## Build & release

- `./release.sh`: interactive menu, then always publishes a GitHub release to
  `frostyosty/htc-downloads-rhc` with a bumped `vX.Y.Z` tag. Option `1`
  (Desktop + all four Android flavors) is the default and the usual choice.
  **Running it publishes a release, so don't run it unless asked.**
- Desktop only: `bash rhc-desktop/build.sh` (run from the repo root; it `cd`s to `/workspaces/RHC-App`).
- One Android flavor: `cd rhc-android && ./gradlew assemble<Flavor>Release`,
  e.g. `assembleGamersMaleNetbeastsRelease`. Faster check without signing:
  `./gradlew compileGamersMaleNetbeastsReleaseKotlin`.
- Built `.apk`/`.exe` files, `local.properties` and `*.jks` are gitignored.
  The release keystore `rhc-android/app/rockhard-keystore.jks` is not in git.
- `zz_quicksave.txt` is the user's add/commit/pull/push script. Don't run it
  unless asked.

## Environment

`.devcontainer/` sets up a fresh Codespace (JDK 17, Android SDK 34 at
`~/android`, mingw-w64, NSIS, and the tools below). `post-create.sh` can be
re-run safely. It restores the keystore from the `RHC_KEYSTORE_B64` Codespaces
secret if that secret is set.

## Tools: when to use them

- **`rg` (ripgrep)**: all text search. `rg -t kotlin 'ShieldRuleEngine'`,
  `rg -t cpp 'WinHttp' rhc-desktop rhc-common`. Skip `rhc-common/src/sqlite3.c`
  (vendored, huge) with `-g '!sqlite3.c'`.
- **`fd`**: finding files by name. `fd -e kt Guardian rhc-android`,
  `fd -e cpp . rhc-desktop/src/ui`. It respects `.gitignore`, so build output
  stays out of results.
- **`shellcheck`**: run after editing any `.sh` (`release.sh`,
  `rhc-desktop/build.sh`, `tools/**/*.sh`, `rhc-android/scripts/*.sh`,
  `.devcontainer/post-create.sh`). `bash -n` only checks syntax; shellcheck
  catches quoting and word-splitting bugs. Aim for zero warnings.
- **`clang-tidy` + `bear`**: static analysis for the desktop/common C++.
  `bear -- bash rhc-desktop/build.sh` writes `compile_commands.json` (gitignore
  it, it's local), then e.g.
  `clang-tidy -p . rhc-desktop/src/Guardian.cpp --checks='-*,bugprone-*,clang-analyzer-*'`.
  clang-tidy doesn't know mingw's Windows headers by default. If it can't find
  `windows.h`, add `--extra-arg=--target=x86_64-w64-mingw32`. Use it on files
  you've changed, not the whole tree, and never on `sqlite3.c`.
- **`ccache`**: `rhc-desktop/build.sh` uses it automatically when it's
  installed, and just compiles normally when it isn't. A full rebuild with
  nothing changed takes about 2.5s instead of about 85s. It only helps because
  each source file is compiled to its own object in `rhc-desktop/obj/` before
  linking, so keep that structure: new `.cpp` files go in the
  `DESKTOP_OBJS`/`COMMON_OBJS` loops, not onto the link line. Check the hit
  rate with `ccache -s`.

## Conventions

- Match the surrounding style: emoji-prefixed `echo` status lines in shell
  scripts, and `set -euo pipefail` in new scripts.
- Keep the Android Kotlin logic and the `rhc-common` C++ engines in sync. A
  change to the rules or scoring in one usually needs the same change in the other.
